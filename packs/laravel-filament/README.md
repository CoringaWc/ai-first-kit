# laravel-filament

Laravel 13 + Filament v5 + Pest + Octane/Swoole stack with production-tested skills (TDD, scaffolding, docker, CI).

Battle-tested in the **Processo Migratório TPA Fernando de Noronha** project. Skills cover the full lifecycle: project bootstrap, Filament Resources/Forms/Tables, Pest unit + feature + browser tests, native Laravel policies and Spatie permission policies, Docker FPM and Octane/Swoole stacks, larastan + pint static analysis, and a `verify-before-commit` gate.

## Usage

Selected from `ai-first-init`'s pack list (once `ai-first-init` supports pack picking). Skills under `skills/` are copied into `<project>/.agents/skills/` when a user scaffolds a project with this pack.

Until `ai-first-init` exposes a pack picker, you can adopt the pack manually:

```bash
cp -r ~/ai-first-kit/packs/laravel-filament/skills/. <your-project>/.agents/skills/
```

## Source

Skills were extracted from the `processo-migratorio-tpa-fernando-de-noronha` project where they were authored and validated against real production work.
